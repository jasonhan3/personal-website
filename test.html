                Hi, my name is Jason, a rising Junior at Rice University studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.
                I enjoy asking questions that to solve challenging problems ranging from data-driven drug discovery for diseases to code generation that can transform software engineering.
                Below is a collection of questions that I've worked on answering: I hope you enjoy!

                <div class="h2">How can we make software integration more efficient?</div>
                <div class="q1-desc">
                    In any company older than thirty years, software engineers face a challenging problem: how do they integrate legacy systems with their modern ones? Legacy systems that use COBOL, for example, may have data formats that aren't compatible with relational databases commonly used today, may not natively support HTTP/HTTPS protocols, and often follow a monolithic architecture rather than the microservice-based architecture prevalent in our Agile environment today.
                    The most common solution has been to write 'scaffolding' software that bridges the legacy software to be compatible with our modern software. However, this software can be very difficult to write because of the differences in architecture. Another less common solution is to attempt to rewrite the legacy software as modern software: however, the return-on-investment of this approach is very low, as the software effectively performs the same function, and rewriting an entire system is very error-prone.
                    Given the advent of generative AI, we are exploring the possibility of using AI to transform
